Abstract This paper reports a detailed analytical and numerical investigation on free con-
vection ﬂow of viscous ﬂuid through a porous medium due to the combined effects of thermal
and mass diffusion. Effect of temperature-dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity is
investigated in the presence of ﬁrst-order chemical reaction. The non-Darcy model is applied
to deﬁne the porous matrix. The effects of viscous and Darcy dissipations are taken into
account. The governing equations of continuity, momentum, energy, and concentration which
are coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations are solved analytically using regular
perturbation method and numerically using Runge–Kutta shooting method. Brinkman num-
ber and variable thermal conductivity parameters are used as perturbation parameters. The
velocity, temperature, and concentration distributions are discussed numerically and plot-
ted in graphs. The effects of variable viscosity parameter, variable thermal conductivity
parameter, thermal Grashof number, mass Grashof number, Brinkman number, wall temper-
ature ratio, and ﬁrst-order chemical reaction parameter on the ﬂow ﬁelds are explored. The
effects of physical parameters such as skin friction and Nusselt number at both the plates
are derived and discussed, and the numerical values for various values of physical parame-
ters are presented in tables. The solutions obtained using Runge–Kutta shooting method and
using perturbation method are compared and the solutions agree very well in the absence of
perturbation parameter.

1 Introduction
Natural convection in differently heated cavities ﬁlled with a ﬂuid-saturated porous media
plays an important role in many practical applications. It has attracted the attention of engi-
neers in recent past owing to its relevance in high-performance insulations for cryogenic
containers, petroleum reservoirs, sensible heat storage beds, coal combustors, risk assess-
ment of radionuclide migration from depositories of nuclear waste, thermal performance of
solar collectors, cooling of electronic systems, nuclear waste repositories, and ground water
hydrology are just some examples of realistic applications where a porous cavity is basi-
cally differentially heated. Convective processes of ﬂuid ﬂow and associated heat transfer in
porous cavities have been studied extensively for the past several decades. Free convective
heat transfer in porous medium has been studied widely in the literature. Nield and Bejan
(2013) gave an excellent summary of the subject.
The growing need for chemical reactions in chemical and hydrometallurgical industries
requires the study of heat and mass transfer in the presence of chemical reaction. There are
many transport processes that are governed by the simultaneous action of buoyancy forces
due to both thermal and mass diffusion in the presence of chemical reaction effect. These
processes are observed in nuclear reactor safety and combustion systems, solar collectors as
well as chemical and metallurgical engineering. Their other applications include solidiﬁca-
tion of binary alloys and crystal growth dispersion of dissolved materials or particulate water
in ﬂows, drying and dehydration operations in chemical and food processing plants, evapora-
tion at the surface of a water body, distribution of temperature and moisture over agricultural
ﬁelds and groves of fruit trees, damage of crops due to freezing, energy transfer in a wet cool-
ing tower and ﬂow in a desert cooler, heat and mass transfer occur simultaneously. Chemical
reaction can be modeled as either homogeneous or heterogeneous processes. This depends
on whether they occur at an interface or a single-phase volume reaction. A homogeneous
reaction is one that occurs uniformly throughout a given phase. The species generation in a
homogeneous reaction is the same as the internal source of heat generation. On the other hand,
heterogeneous reaction takes place in a restricted area or within the boundary of a phase.
The order of the chemical reaction depends on several factors. One of the simplest chemical
reactions is the ﬁrst-order reaction in which the rate of reaction is directly proportional to the
species concentration. In many chemical engineering processes, a chemical reaction between
a foreign mass and the ﬂuid does occur. These processes takes place in numerous industrial
applications, such as the polymer production, the manufacturing of ceramics or glass ware,
the food processing. The study of heat and mass transfer with chemical reaction is of great
practical importance to engineers and scientists because of its almost universal occurrence
in many branches of science and engineering. Muthucumaraswamy and Ganeshan (2000,
2001) have studied the impulsive motion of a vertical plate with heat ﬂux/mass ﬂux/suction
and diffusion of chemically reactive species. Seddeek (2005) have studied the ﬁnite ele-
ment method for the effect of chemical reaction, variable viscosity, thermophoresis and heat
generation/absorption on a boundary layer hydromagnetic ﬂow with heat and mass transfer
over a heat surface. Kandasamy et al. (2005a, 2005b) have examined the effects of chemical
reaction, heat and mass transfer with or without MHD ﬂow with heat source/suction.
Most of the existing analytical studies for this problem are based on the constant physical
properties of the ambient ﬂuid. More accurate prediction for the ﬂow and heat transfer can
be achieved by taking into account variation of these properties with temperature (Herwig
and Wicken 1986), especially for ﬂuid viscosity and thermal conductivity. To accurately pre-
dict the ﬂow and heat transfer rates, it is necessary to take into account the effects of these
variations. For lubricating ﬂuids, heat generated by internal friction and the corresponding

rise in the temperature affects the physical properties of the ﬂuid and are no longer assumed
to be constant. The increase in temperature leads to increase in the transport phenomena by
reducing the physical properties across the thermal boundary layer and so the heat transfer at
the wall is also affected. Therefore to predict the ﬂow and heat transfer rates, it is necessary
to take into account the variable ﬂuid properties. Klemp et al. (1990) studied the effect of
temperature-dependent viscosity on the entrance ﬂow in a channel in the hydrodynamic case.
The effects of variable viscosity on hydromagnetic ﬂow and heat transfer have been studied by
Seddeek (2002). Natural convection ﬂow of a viscous Newtonian ﬂuid having temperature-
dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity over an isothermal vertical wavy cone was
studied by Hossain and Munir (2001a) and Hossain et al. (2001b) neglecting viscous dissi-
pation effects. Attia (2008) considered unsteady hydromagnetic Couette ﬂow of dusty ﬂuid
with temperature dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity under exponentially decay-
ing pressure gradient and solved the governing equations numerically using ﬁnite difference
method. Recently, Kalidas (2012) investigated the inﬂuence of thermophoresis and chemical
reaction on MHD micropolar ﬂuid ﬂow with variable ﬂuid properties. Barletta (1997) and
Zanchini (1997) have pointed out that relevant effects of viscous dissipation in the fully devel-
oped laminar forced convection in tubes. Thus, an analysis of the effects of viscous and Darcy
dissipation in the fully developed mixed convection in vertical duct appears as interesting.
The aim of the present paper is to study the velocity, temperature and concentration distrib-
ution within a vertical channel with variable properties. The combined effect of viscosity and
thermal conductivity on temperature is analyzed. The effects of various governing parameters
on the ﬂow and concentration ﬁelds are explored.
2 Mathematical Formulation
Consider a steady laminar, fully developed ﬂow of an incompressible, viscous, permeable
ﬂuid between two parallel plates. The distance between the plates is 2b, and the origin of
coordinate axis is located in the mid-plane of the channel. The two plates are kept at two
constant temperatures T1 for the left plate and T2 for the right plate. The channel is assumed
to occupy the region of space−b ≤Y ≤b. A ﬂuid rises in the channel driven by buoyancy
forces. The no-slip boundary condition is imposed on the parallel plates for the velocity, and
since the plates are inﬁnite in the X-direction, the physical variables are invariant in these
directions and the problem is essentially one dimensional with velocity component U (Y)
along the X axis.
The physical properties characterizing the ﬂuid except density, viscosity and thermal
conductivity are assumed to be constant. As customary, the Boussinesq approximation and
the equation of state
ρ = ρ0 [1 −βT (T −T0) −βC(C −C0)] .
(1)
will be adopted. The ﬂow and heat transfer of viscous, permeable ﬂuid is examined consid-
ering viscosity and thermal conductivity dependent temperature.
The momentum equations governing the motion of an incompressible permeable ﬂuid
in the presence of viscous and Darcy dissipations with the variable viscosity and variable
thermal conductivity are given by

where U is the velocity of the ﬂuid, T the temperature of the ﬂuid, D is the diffusion
coefﬁcient, C is the concentration of the ﬂuid, ρ0 the static density, βT the coefﬁcient of
thermal expansion, βC the concentration expansion coefﬁcient, κ the permeability parameter,
g the acceleration due to gravity, μ the viscosity and K the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid.
The boundary conditions on the velocity and temperature ﬁelds are given as
U = 0 at Y = ±b
(5)
T = T1 at Y = −b, T = T2 at Y = b
(6)
C = Cw at Y = −b, C = C0 at Y = b
(7)
The ﬂuid viscosity μ is assumed to vary with temperature as (Saravanan and Kandaswamy
2004; Attia 2006)
μ = μ0e−a(T −T0)
(8)
where the subscript 0 denotes the reference state and a an empirical constant.
In Eq. (8), the viscosity μ is assumed to depend on temperature exponentially. The para-
meter a may take positive values for liquids such as water, benzene or crude oil. In some
gases like air, helium or methane a may be negative, i.e., the coefﬁcient viscosity increases
with temperature (Sutton and Sherman 1965; Schlichting 1968). This type of model can ﬁnd
applications in many processes where preheating of the fuel is used as a means to enhance heat
transfer effects. In addition, for many ﬂuids such as lubricants, polymers, and coal slurries
where viscous dissipation is substantial, an appropriate constitutive relation where viscosity
is a function of temperature should be used.
The thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid is assumed as (Attia 2006)
K = K0 (1 + b1 (T −T0))
(9)
The thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid is assumed to vary with temperature as can be seen in
Eq. (9) where the parameter b may be positive for some ﬂuids such as air or water vapor or
negative for others like liquid water or benzene (Schlichting 1968; White 1991). The thermal
conductivity changes approximately linearly with temperature in the range from 0 to 400◦F.
Equations (2–4) determine the velocity, temperature, and concentration distribution, and
they can be written in a dimensionless form by means of the following dimensionless para-

Equations (11–13) show that the dimensionless velocity, temperature, and concentration
ﬁelds depend on the parameters: the viscosity parameter bv, the conductivity parameter bk,
the porous parameter σ, the Brinkman number Br, chemical reaction parameter α and the
wall temperature ratio m.
3 Solutions
The solution of Eq. (13) can be obtained directly by integrating Eq. (13), and the solution is
φ = c1e−√αy + c2e
√αy
(17)
where c1 and c2 are integrating constants and can be evaluated using boundary conditions as
deﬁned in Eq. (16).
Equations (11) and (12) are coupled nonlinear equations, and it is difﬁcult in general
to ﬁnd analytical solutions. However approximate analytical solutions can be found using
regular perturbation method. We shall perform a perturbation analysis for the nonlinear Eqs.
(11) and (12) considering
u = u0 + Bru1 and θ = θ0 + Brθ1
(18)
Substituting (18) into Eqs. (11) and (12) and equating terms with the same powers of Br, we
obtain the following sequence of boundary value problems for u0, θ0, u1 and θ1

The Eqs. (19–22) are still nonlinear equations and hence closed form solutions cannot be
found. Hence we apply once again the perturbation method using variable conductivity para-
meter as the perturbation parameter only for the zeroth-order Eqs. (19) and (20) as follows
u0 = u00 + bku01;
θ0 = θ00 + bkθ01
(23)
Substituting (23) into Eqs. (19) and (20) and equating terms with the same powers of bk, we
obtain the following sequence of boundary values problems for u00, θ00, u01 and θ01

where c3, c4, c5, c6, c7 and c8 are integrating constants which can be evaluated using bound-
ary conditions (14) and (15) after substituting (18) and (23). The solution of Eq. (27) is not
found as it is very tedious.
3.1 Numerical Solutions
Theanalyticalsolutionsobtainedintheabovesectionarevalidforsmallvaluesofperturbation
parameters. Further it is seen in the above section that it is not possible to ﬁnd solutions of even
the ﬁrst order. Hence we resort to solve the governing equations by numerical methods using
Runge–Kutta shooting method (RKSM). The validity of RKSM is justiﬁed by comparing the
solutions with the results obtained by the perturbation method, and the values are displayed
in tables. The perturbation method and RKSM solutions agree very well in the absence of
perturbation parameter.

The above equations are solved and the results are tabulated in Table 1 for different
governing parameters.
4 Results and Discussion
In this section, the results obtained for the heat and mass transfer in a vertical channel con-
taining ﬂuid-saturated porous medium are discussed. The Darcy–Brinkman model is used
to deﬁne the governing equations. The exponential dependent of the viscosity and linear
dependence of thermal conductivity on temperature is studied. The variations of these result-
ing terms with the variable viscosity parameter bv and thermal conductivity parameter bk
and their relative magnitude have an importance on the velocity, temperature and concen-
tration ﬁelds. The major parameter such as thermal Grashof number GRT , mass Grashof
number GRC, Brinkman number Br, the wall temperature ratio m, porous parameter σ and
ﬁrst-order chemical reaction parameter α on the ﬂow for positive and negative values of vis-
cosity parameter bv and the conductivity parameter bk is numerically evaluated and depicted
graphically. The governing equations which are coupled and highly nonlinear are solved
analytically using regular perturbation method (PM) and numerically using Runge–Kutta
shooting method (RKSM). The validity of RKSM is justiﬁed by comparing the solutions of
RKSM with PM.
The effects of viscosity variation parameter bv on the velocity and temperature ﬁelds are
seen in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively, ﬁxing the variable thermal conductivity parameter. As
the viscosity variation parameter bv increases, ﬂow increases and the proﬁles for constant
viscosity (bv = 0) lie above bv < 0 and below bv > 0 on velocity and temperature ﬁelds.
The variable viscosity parameter bv on the ﬂow was the similar result observed by Attia
(2001) on the MHD channel ﬂow of dusty ﬂuids. Keeping the value of variable viscosity
parameter bv ﬁxed, the effect of variable thermal conductivity parameter bk on the ﬂow is
shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. It is seen that as the thermal conductivity parameter
increases, both the velocity and temperature ﬁelds are suppressed. The proﬁles for constant
thermal conductivity (bk = 0) lie above bk > 0 and below bk < 0. The effect of thermal
conductivity parameter bk is in contrast to the effect of variable viscosity parameter bv (Figs.
1, 2). The effect of bk on the ﬂow was the similar result observed by Attia (1999) and Palani
and Kim (2010).
TheeffectofthermalGrashofnumber GRT andmassGrashofnumber GRC onthevelocity
and temperature ﬁelds is displayed in Figs. 5, 6, 7, and 8. As the thermal Grashof number
GRT and mass Grashof number GRC increase, the velocity and temperature ﬁelds increase.

implies an increase in buoyancy force which supports the motion. Since the thermal Grashof
number GRT acts as the driving mechanism of the driving force in the momentum equation,
the velocity and/or velocity gradientincreases and therefore the effectof dissipation increases,
which results in the enhancement of temperature ﬁeld. The effects of GRT and GRC on the
ﬂow were the similar results observed by Shivaiah and Anandrao (2012) for the ﬂow past
a porous vertical plate for constant properties. The effect of Brinkman number Br on the
velocity and temperature ﬁeld is shown in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. It is evident from

these ﬁgures that as the Brinkman number Br increases, the ﬂow is promoted. This is due
to the fact that an increase in the Brinkman number Br results in the increase in dissipation
effects which results in the increase in temperature and as a consequence velocity increases
for the increase in buoyancy force in the momentum equation. The wall temperature ratio m

ﬁxing the values of bv, bk, GRT , GRC, Br, σ and α can be viewed in Figs. 11 and 12. It
is seen that as the wall temperature ratio m increases, the ﬂow is enhanced. It is interesting
to note that for negative values of m, there is a ﬂow reversal at the left wall. Since the wall

as seen in Figs. 13 and 14. This is also an expected result because physically, large values of
porous parameter σ correspond to densely packed porous medium and hence ﬂow rate will
be reduced. The effect of porous parameter σ on the ﬂow was the similar result observed by
Umavathi and Veershetty (2012) for constant properties. The effects of ﬁrst-order chemical
reaction parameter α on the velocity, temperature, and concentration ﬁelds are depicted
in Figs. 15, 16, and 17. It is evident from these ﬁgures that the velocity, temperature, and

increase in the number of solute molecules undergoing chemical reaction which decreases the
ﬂuid ﬁeld. This is the similar result observed by Damesh and Shannak (2010) for viscoelastic
ﬂuid, and Krishnendu (2012) for viscous ﬂuid with constant properties. The effect of variable

increasing the values of bv show that skin friction and Nusselt number increase at the left
wall and decrease at the right wall. The thermal Grashof number GRT , mass Grashof number
GRC, and Brinkman number Br increase the skin friction and Nusselt number at the left
wall and decrease at the right wall. For increase in the wall temperature ratio m, skin friction
increases at the left wall and decreases at the right wall whereas the Nusselt number decreases
at both the walls. The porous parameter σ and ﬁrst-order chemical reaction parameter α
decrease the skin friction and Nusselt number at the left wall and increase at the right wall.
The analytical solutions obtained by regular perturbation methods are valid only for small
values of perturbation parameter. To overcome this restriction, the governing equations are
solved using Runge–Kutta shooting method. The validity of Runge–Kutta shooting method is
justiﬁed by comparing the results obtained by perturbation method and Runge–Kutta shooting
method in the absence of Brinkman number Br and is displayed in Table 2. It is viewed that
the analytical and numerical solutions are exact for bk = 0. The error increases as the second
perturbation parameter bk increases.
5 Conclusion
The problem of free convective ﬂow, heat and mass transfer in a vertical channel ﬁlled with
porous medium was analyzed for the variation of viscosity and thermal conductivity on the
temperature. The analytical solutions were found by perturbation parameter method valid for
small values of perturbation parameter, and numerical solutions were found by Runge–Kutta
shooting method valid for any values of governing parameters. The Runge–Kutta shooting
method and perturbation method show good agreement in the absence of Brinkman number
and conductivity variation parameter. The following results were drawn.
1. Increase in the variable viscosity parameter enhances the ﬂow and heat transfer, whereas
increase in the variable thermal conductivity parameter suppresses the ﬂow and heat
transfer.
2. The thermal Grashof number, mass Grashof number, wall temperature ratio, and
Brinkman number enhance the ﬂow.

3. The increase in porous parameter and chemical reaction parameter suppresses the
ﬂow. The variable viscosity parameter, variable thermal conductivity parameter, ther-
mal Grashof number, mass Grashof number, wall temperature ratio, Brinkman number,
and porous parameter were invariant on concentration ﬁeld.
4. The solutions obtained by Runge–Kutta shooting method and perturbation method are
exact in the absence of Brinkman number and variable conductivity parameter, and the
error increases as the variable conductivity parameter increases.
5. The obtained results agreed very well with Attia (2006) for variable properties and with
Umavathi (1996) for constant properties.
